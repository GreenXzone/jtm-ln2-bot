# jtm-ln2-bot
A simple Lineage 2 (Rev) Quest bot for windows desktop emulator.

This is a very basic bot (created just as POC, and im tired tapping quests :D), but it handles the *basic* quests well. This tool lacks a lot of possible functionalities but I did not included them in one release. If I received a good **[feedback and demand](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)** for this tool I will enhance this, maintain, and add other features to it.

## Issues so far
- disabled auto respawn to quest when died
- if there are no basic quests it stops
- delay transition in tap quest when it is still in quest
